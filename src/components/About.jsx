            About Heir &amp; Heritage
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
            Heir &amp; Heritage was born from a vision — a desire to bring back
            the enduring elegance of old-money style in a world rushing toward
            fast fashion. Our name says it all: “Heir” represents the modern
            gentleman who understands his worth, and “Heritage” honors the
            timeless values of sophistication, craftsmanship, and legacy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg mb-6">
            At Heir &amp; Heritage, we believe that true style is not loud —
            it’s effortless, refined, and rooted in tradition. Our collection of
            men’s clothing and accessories reflects the quiet confidence of
            those who don’t chase trends, but set their own standard. From
            tailored shirts and cashmere knits to polished leather accessories
            and heritage-inspired details, each piece is curated to echo a
            lifestyle of grace, legacy, and understated luxury.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            We take pride in blending the charm of old-world fashion with the
            needs of the modern man. Our design philosophy draws inspiration
            from vintage European tailoring, Ivy League aesthetics, British
            aristocracy, and classic continental menswear — reimagined for the
            discerning gentleman of today. Whether you’re dressing for a
            business lunch, a weekend estate gathering, or simply to command
            presence in everyday life, Heir &amp; Heritage helps you express
            your best self — without shouting.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
            Sustainability and quality are at the heart of everything we do. We
            partner with ethical artisans and trusted manufacturers to ensure
            that every garment and accessory meets our uncompromising standards.
            These are not just clothes — they are investments in your personal
            legacy.

            Heir &amp; Heritage isn’t just a brand. It’s a lifestyle. It’s for
            the man who values tradition, yet understands the power of
            individuality. It’s for those who know that being well-dressed is
            more than appearance — it’s an attitude, a mindset, and a mark of
            respect for oneself and others.
